### Exercise 

 1. ***Plot restaurants across Cebu.***
	- Using Places API, it has restriction to get only 20 and upto 60 records if using pagination. Added button More Results to display the records.
 2.  ***Each restaurant will have at least 1 food specialty.*** 
	 - There's no specialty field when using nearbysearch Places API (I think) so I didn't place or display one.
	 - sample response:  
			`geometry:{location:  _.K,  viewport:  _.qc}

 3.  ***A layer panel can filter the restaurant type to show.***
	 - In the right-panel, indicated types which I think can display different types of restaurant based on what I got in Places API
		 - Food
		 - Restaurant
		 - Cafe
		 - Store
		 - Meal Delivery
		 - Night Club
	 - Refresh the list when Type is changed
 4.  ***Each restaurant can keep track of the number of customers that visited.***
	 - Using FourSquare API, get and display Check-in and Customer count in infowindow of marker
 5.  ***Customers can get direction to the restaurant from current location.*** 
	 - Clicking the item in the List will set the direstions from point A to point B
 6.  ***Draw a circle or rectangle on the map and and show the number of restaurants within the circle or rectangle.***
	 - Using Drawing Manager, I enabled only the Circle. Can see this at the top of the page, hand tool and circle tool.
	 - When used, it will display the number of restaurants (or type when you changed it) in a marker
	 - Also added search feature around the radius of the circle to display other restaurants.
 8.  Add any value adding feature like analytics to show relationships between patrons, restaurant and revenue.
